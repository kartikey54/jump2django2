# Findings


### URL pattern
~~ REGEX ~~ Flask like integer input <int:varName>, didn't have to stackoverflow to get desirable input when passing vars in url like in earlier versions.
Pretty straight forward. You'll pick it up in a second if you have used Flask.
url can be used instead of path for urlmatching

### Bootstrapped Admin Section
This doesn't make a lot of difference to your way of dev but responsive widgets are welcome.

## Removed py2 support
I accidently started the server with the wrong py version and a bunch of py2 errors started popping up

> In conclusion, a lot hasn't been changed the workflow still remains the same
